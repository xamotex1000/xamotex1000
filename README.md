<details><summary>My Journey Into Programming</summary>

I embarked on my programming journey at the age of 13 with a dream of designing my own game. Starting in Unity, I quickly encountered the challenge of C# but found relief during my freshman year of high school when I enrolled in a computer programming class. There, I learned JavaScript essentials and was captivated by the endless possibilities. Experimenting with small projects, I later ventured into HTML to create a file-sharing website for my friends. Later that year, one of my friends started joking about me getting a job at Valve, as he had wanted them to make a Team Fortress 2 update. This prompted me to look into it and find out that Valve had the exact working structure that matched my style.

Dabbling in C#, I ventured into modding a game I was passionate about, finding a warm and welcoming community of moderators. Despite encountering burnout during the final stretch of my mod, I took a break from development, eventually abandoning the project after the games developers added the main idea of the mod to the game.

Roughly 6 months passed by and I joined a Youtuber's minecraft server. I enjoyed the server for a while before asking the now owner of the server if i could join the development team. He decided to give me a chance and let me show my skills. He later gave me a future update to work on, and i focused on adding many features for that update. A few days later, I was informed that the server would be going under a rebrand, as the owner decided that they wanted to step away. The new owner and I would brainstorm names for the server as we went under the rebrand, and we eventually settled on the name "RealmForged". That brings us to today, I've been dedicating most of my waking hours to this project, as i think it has the potential to be great. We're planning on going into beta sometime in october of 2024.

Now, I'm dedicated to expanding my skills, aiming for a computer engineering degree, and hoping to pursue a career at Valve in my 20s.

I don't check any other social media dms, but whether you have questions, collaboration opportunities, or just want to chat, my Friend Requests are open.

### Collaboration

I'm open to collaborating with other developers on projects. Whether it's pair programming, contributing to open-source projects, or joint project development, I'm down for whatever.

### Future Plans

My main goal is to acquire enough skills to get hired at Valve. Other than that I want to make my dream game before I turn 30. No other long-term goals or aspirations within the field of software engineering at the moment.

### Projects

I enjoy building various projects to refine my skills and explore new technologies. Due to low motivation, tons of my projects were abandoned half way through development and never saw the light of day, but I'll finish them I swear!!! also im currently more into application building than game building.
