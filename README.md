# Hello, I'm Milo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a high school student passionate about software engineering and creating cool projects. My main focus on GitHub is to explore, learn, and build various projects.

## About Me

- ðŸŽ“ Currently in high school, doing high school things.
- ðŸ’» Interested in software engineering and exploring different programming languages and technologies.
- ðŸŒ± Currently expanding my knowledge in Python and learning C# to broaden my skillset.

## Experience

- **Primary Languages**: JavaScript, HTML, Bash
- **Secondary**: Python
- **Learning**: C#

<details><summary>Indepth Story</summary>

 I got into programming at the age of 13 due to me wanting to design my very own game. I started in Unity and quickly became burnt out due to not knowing anything about C#. 
 Once I got around to my freshman year in highschool I took a computer programming class which drastically helped ease me into the world of programming. That class taught JavaScript essentials and I immediately became enamored with the possibilities of what I could do. I made several small projects before finally branching out to html because I wanted to make a file sharing website for friends.
 After about a year of nothing new, my uncle who majored in computer science told me about some major performance benefits of Linux, which I immediately installed on my computer because my boot drive was clogged full of windows app data. Since then I've been using Ubuntu, which led me to learn Bash, a scripting language for automation in unix-based environments.
 I eventually decided to ease myself into c# by modding [a game I was invested in at the time.](https://www.plateupgame.com/) The moderators of the games modding discord server were incredibly warm and welcoming. Something that not many popular games can say. After almost finishing a mod and then getting burnt out at the final stretch, I took a break from programming as a whole.
 During that school year, I befriended a nice group of people. One of those people were a super big fan of Valve games and wanted me to work there for the sole reason of wanting a Team Fortress 2 update. This led me to researching the job and finding out that Valve has the exact work environment that I'd want to work in. This set a goal in my mind to get to a point in my early 20's where I'm living in Washington and working at Valve. 
 This is where the present day lies, I'm working hard to learn as much as possible until I eventually (hopefully) get a computer engineering degree and apply for a job at Valve.
 If anyone wants to reach out with information on anything you think I might want to know, it'd be greatly appreciated.

## Projects

I like building various projects to hone my skills and explore new technologies. Most of them aren't currently up on the site due to them being half cooked, but I'm gonna finish them I swear!
