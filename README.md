<details><summary>Indepth Story</summary>

I got into programming at the age of 13 due to wanting to design my very own game. I started in unity and quickly became burnt out due to not knowing anything about C#. Once I got around to my freshman year in highschool I took a computer programming class which drastically helped ease me into the world of programming. That class taught JavaScript essentials and I immediately became enamored in the possibilities of what I could do. I made several small projects before finally branching out to html because I wanted to make a file sharing website for friends. After a year or so of nothing new, my uncle who majored in computer science told me about some major performance benefits of Linux, which I immediately installed on my computer because my boot drive was clogged full of app data. Since then I've been using Ubuntu, which led me to learning Bash, a scripting language for automation in unix-based environments. I eventually decided to ease myself into c# by modding a game I was invested in at the time. The moderators of the games modding discord server were incredibly warm and welcoming. Something that not many popular games can say. After almost finishing a mod and then getting burnt out at the final stretch, I took a break from programming as a whole. Eventually school started up again, and I decided to take another programming class, this time it was learning python essentials. At the current time of writing this I am taking that class and can't think of a way to end this long story so goodbye!

## Projects

I like building various projects to hone my skills and explore new technologies. Most of them aren't currently up on the site due to them being half cooked, but I'm gonna finish them I swear!
